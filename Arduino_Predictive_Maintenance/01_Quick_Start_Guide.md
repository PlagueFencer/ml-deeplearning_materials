# Quick Start Guide: Arduino + ML for Predictive Maintenance

## What You'll Learn
This guide will help you build a predictive maintenance system using Arduino sensors and machine learning in just 1 week.

## Prerequisites
- No prior Arduino or ML experience needed
- A computer with USB port
- Willingness to learn fast!

## Learning Path Overview

### Week 1 Focus Areas
1. **Arduino Basics** (Days 1-2)
2. **Python & Data Analysis** (Days 2-3)
3. **Machine Learning Fundamentals** (Days 3-4)
4. **Integration & Demo** (Days 4-7)

## What is Predictive Maintenance?

Predictive maintenance uses sensor data and machine learning to predict when equipment will fail BEFORE it actually fails. This saves money, prevents downtime, and improves safety.

### Real-World Example
Instead of checking a motor every month (scheduled maintenance) or waiting for it to break (reactive maintenance), we monitor:
- Vibration levels
- Temperature
- Current draw
- Sound patterns

When these signals show abnormal patterns, we predict: "This motor will likely fail in 3-5 days" and schedule maintenance proactively.

## Your Project Goal

Build a system that:
1. ✅ Collects sensor data from Arduino
2. ✅ Sends data to a computer
3. ✅ Analyzes data with ML model
4. ✅ Detects anomalies (unusual patterns)
5. ✅ Alerts when maintenance is needed

## Next Steps
- Read `02_Arduino_Crash_Course.md`
- Follow `03_Python_ML_Basics.md`
- Build your demo with `04_Integration_Guide.md`
